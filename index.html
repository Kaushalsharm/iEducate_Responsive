            <p class="sectionsubTag text-Small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework,
                such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach
                but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning
                through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other
                classifications focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and student-centered education, and
                on subjects, such as science education, language education, and physical education. Additionally, the
                term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic
                field studying educational phenomena.The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are
                disagreements about the aims of education and the extent to which education differs from indoctrination
                by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements impact how to identify, measure, and enhance various
                forms of education. Essentially, education socializes children into society by instilling cultural
                values and norms, equipping them with the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In
                doing so, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized
                institutions play a significant role in education. For instance, governments establish education
                policies to determine the timing of school classes, the curriculum, and attendance requirements.
                International organizations, such as UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for
                all children.

                Many factors influence the success of education. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence,
                and personality. Social factors, such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often
                associated with discrimination. Other factors encompass access to educational technology, teacher
                quality, and parental involvement.

            <p class="sectionTag text-Big">Transforming Education in India</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-Small">The term "education" originates from the Latin words educare, meaning
                "to bring up," and educere, meaning "to bring forth."The definition of education has been explored
                by theorists from various fields.Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at
                achieving goals like the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.However, extensive
                debate surrounds its precise nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a
                process occurring during events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.Another perspective
                perceives education not as a process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated individuals
                resulting from this process.Furthermore, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies
                the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.Having a clear
                understanding of the term is crucial when attempting to identify educational phenomena, measure
                educational success, and improve educational practices.

                Some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying specific features exclusive to all forms of
                education. Education theorist R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features of
                education, including imparting knowledge and understanding to the student, ensuring the process is
                beneficial, and conducting it in a morally appropriate manner.While such precise definitions often
                characterize the most typical forms of education effectively, they face criticism because less common
                types of education may occasionally fall outside their parameters.Dealing with counterexamples not
                covered by precise definitions can be challenging, which is why some theorists prefer offering less
                exact definitions based on family resemblance instead. This approach suggests that all forms of
                education are similar to each other but need not share a set of essential features common to all.
                Some education theorists, such as Keira Sewell and Stephen Newman, argue that the term "education" is
                context-dependent.

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-Small">Evaluative or thick conceptions of education assert that it is inherent
                in the nature of education to lead to some form of improvement. They contrast with thin conceptions,
                which offer a value-neutral explanation.Some theorists provide a descriptive conception of education by
                observing how the term is commonly used in ordinary language. Prescriptive conceptions, on the other
                hand, define what constitutes good education or how education should be practiced.Many thick and
                prescriptive conceptions view education as an endeavor that strives to achieve specific objectives,which
                may encompass acquiring knowledge, learning to think rationally, and cultivating character traits such
                as kindness and honesty.

                Various scholars emphasize the importance of critical thinking in distinguishing education from
                indoctrination.They argue that indoctrination focuses solely on instilling beliefs in students,
                regardless of their rationality,whereas education also encourages the rational ability to critically
                examine and question those beliefs.However, it is not universally accepted that these two phenomena can
                be clearly distinguished, as some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of
                education when the child's mind is not yet fully developed. This is particularly relevant in cases where
                young children must learn certain things without comprehending the underlying reasons, such as specific
                safety rules and hygiene practices.

                Education can be characterized from both the teacher's and the student's perspectives. Teacher-centered
                definitions emphasize the perspective and role of the teacher in transmitting knowledge and skills in a
                morally appropriate manner.On the other hand, student-centered definitions analyze education based on
                the student's involvement in the learning process, suggesting that this process transforms and enriches
                their subsequent experiences.
